        The name is Basit Adebayo, a shy person who does not like to
        talk much, I prefer listening to people talk though where contribution
        is required I do not shy away from it. I am from the capital of Oyo
        State, Ibadan where I spent most of my years and attended my
        primary and secondary schools. I went to the "Better By Far" university,
        University of Iorin where I studied Civil Enginnering, a 5 years course
        which later turned to 6-7 years course due to corona virus and ASUU
        strikes.

        Manchester United being the best club in England and in the World is my
        favorite and the club that I support, the Oluyole warriors (3SC) comes
        second and the Nigeria Super Eagles follows as it is my National team.

      <h2>Why I joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
      <p>
        <em>ALT/SOE/024/1158</em>, In 2018 during my 100 level days my friends and I had a chance to learn
        tech from a hostel mate but none of us had a working system which hinder
        our chance of learning it then. So when I saw AltSchool advertisement on
        NYSC WhatsApp group offering scholarship for qualified candidate, I said
        to my self "Opportunity comes but twice, to me", I got the NYSC 70%
        scholarship.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is next after NYSC? Well I have to find a means to survive, a job
        to sustain myself and other things I need and want to do and tech being
        Tech provides job opportunities around the globe, has no age restriction
        meaning that I can work for a long period of time as I want and other
        benefits. Though it is said that my WHY is not enough but I know that my
        needs and want I want to do makes my WHY substantial. And also with the
        opportunity that I have I want to also give back to the community In Sha
        Allah.
